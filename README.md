# weather-dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard is a primitive form of a user's personal page generated using calls to the Open Weather Map's Geocoding, Current Weather Data, and  5 day / 3 hour Forecast Data APIs. The project dynamically makes calls to the APIs and prints all relevant data for users. Additionally, a user's search history is saved in such a way that it might be accessed again for later searches. 

The application is now live and may be accessed [here.](https://csanchezwagenbach.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

## Installation

No special steps required for installation. Application may be accessed on any internet browser.

## Usage

## Credits

This project could not have been built without the teams building and maintaining the Open Weather Map APIs.
